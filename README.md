# project-structure

## Overview

The content of this repository comprises a half day instruction in advanced tidyverse code, 
together with implementation of data analysis project structures that can be applied to any data analysis workflow.

The content herein concludes a 3-day introductory R workshop given in University College Cork, 
as part of the [2018 UCC Teaching & Learning Research and Enhancement Fund](https://www.ucc.ie/en/teachlearn/projects/tlrefund/ "Link to the UCC grant") 
to support innovative teaching pedagogies within UCC. The overriding aim is to introduce researchers, who lack an overall background in statistical programming, 
to be able to use the R statistical language in their day-to-day analyses.

The files, data and scripts in this collection brings together the introductory materials delivered in the initial two and a half day sessions. 
Following this course, participants will have the tools to conduct basis statistical analyses of their data, 
but also be able to give organisation to their overall research project workflows.

The session is split into five unequal parts:
+ Part A: Script structure and syntax
+ Part B: R Projects
+ Part C: readr & tidyr
+ Part D: dplyr
+ Part E: ggplot2

Once participants have tamed their own folder structures and file names and content, I humbly suggest moving on to using git and GitHub for 
version control and a bit of piece-of-mind. Notes to a walk-through I gave on linking GitHub with RStudio can be found
